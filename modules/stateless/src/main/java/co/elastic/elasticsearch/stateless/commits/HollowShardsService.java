/**
 * Functionality around the hollowing of inactive shards to reduce their memory footprint.
 *
 * A regular unhollow indexing shard will be relocated as a hollow shard if it deemed hollowable according to the criteria set by
 * {@link HollowShardsService#isHollowableIndexShard(IndexShard)}.
 *
 * This class manages ingestion blockers which are installed for hollow shards to block ingestion. Any ingestion will trigger the
 * unhollowing of the shard which will uninstall the blocker and let ingestion pass through. An ingestion blocker is also removed when
 * a shard closes.
 *
 * The hollow process is implemented in {@link TransportStatelessPrimaryRelocationAction} and is summarized as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The source indexing shard acquires all primary permits when marked as relocated, and installs an ingestion blocker with
 *      {@link HollowShardsService#addHollowShard(IndexShard,String)}.</li>
 * <li> The source indexing shard resets the engine, which flushes a hollow commit, and switches to the {@link HollowIndexEngine}</li>
 * <li> The target indexing shard recovers with a {@link HollowIndexEngine}.</li>
 * <li> The target indexing shard installs an ingestion blocker.</li>
 * </ul>
