/**
 * {@link OnlinePrewarmingService} implementation specific to our stateless search nodes. This aims to prewarm all the segments of the
 * provided {@link IndexShard} by reading the data from the blob store and writing it to the cache, unless the segments are already warm
 * in which case the prewarm operation is a no-op.
 *
 * Weâ€™re aiming to download the first region (currently 16MB) of every segment. A segment is composed of multiple files: fields,
 * fields data, fields index, term index, term dictionary etc.
 * Some of the small files that most searches will need are the term index file (tip) and points index (kdi). These small files reside at
 * the beginning of the blob (i.e. the first region) we store in the blob store.
 *
 * Note that this service is executing on the hot path for the query phase, sometimes on the transport_worker thread, so it needs to be
 * very fast and efficient. There is another service that does various cache warming operations in {@link SharedBlobCacheWarmingService}
 * however, due to that service being quite heavy already (both in terms of responsibility - currently handling three different types of
 * warming with different needs and different methods - and objects created) we decided to keep the search online prewarming separately
 * and contained.
