/**
 * A credit manager that can be shared by multiple {@link RefreshBurstableThrottler} shard throttlers. Whenever the credits are consumed,
 * the shard throttler is throttled, and a warning is shown. Credits are gathered in a similar manner as the shard throttler, but with a
 * couple of differences:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Credits can have a multiplier so that more than 1 credit per throttling interval can be accumulated.</li>
 *     <li>The credits are a <code>double</code> and can be accumulated in fraction.</li>
 *     <li>Credits range <code>[-maxCredits, maxCredits]</code> where max credits are the shard's throttler max credits * multiplier.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note that the aim of the node credits are to be a safety net of imposing a maximum average of 1 refresh / 5 seconds / 4GB over the past
 * hour. Thus if enough shards are bursting and deplete the node's credits, node-wide refresh throttling is imposed (shards do 1 refresh /
 * 5 sec).
 *
 * In contrast to the shard throttler, the node credits can be negative. While the shard throttler does not allow more than one refresh
 * in a throttled situation, unfortunately the same is not true on the node level since shards are guaranteed a scheduled refresh. E.g., if
 * there are 1M shards, we'd have 1M refreshes happening even when throttled at 1refresh/5sec. Imagine if the node credits could not be
 * negative, they'd be 0. And imagine suddenly that all refreshes stop. The shards and the node will start accumulating credits. This would
 * mean new refreshes on a single shard (for example) will be able to go uninterrupted/bursting, while in the previous hour we had
 * 1M refreshes / 5sec node-wide. This is the problem: bursting is immediately allowed node-wide even though the node limit on the last hour
 * is heavily surpassed, and it should be still throttling. For this reason, we said to allow negative credits in the node credits.
 * There will need to be some time passed for the node credits to recover to positive and allow bursting.
 *
 * Also note we use a heuristic of doubling credit accumulation when credits are negative to help when trying to recover from a throttled
 * situation. Because:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Otherwise, something that happened longer ago than one hour can affect throttling.</li>
 *     <li>The only way to avoid the above point correctly is to capture a sliding window of requests, which would be more complicated
 *     and keep more data.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Example: imagine that a user is in a very throttled situation, and has depleted the node credits over the last hour. They realize and
 * "fix" their workload to have less refreshes (that would be allowed by the node budget). However, because the node credits were previously
 * exhausted at -maxCredits, the new refreshes will still be throttled for a while. It may take, e.g., a couple of hours for the node
 * credits to become positive again. This is punitive for those users that try to fix their workloads. For this reason, we thought of
 * this "easy" heuristic to be more forgiving is to double the credits accumulation when recovering from negative credits.
