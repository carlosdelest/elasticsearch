# This pipeline serves as the entry point for your service's quality gates definitions. When
# properly configured, it will be invoked automatically as part of the automated
# promotion process once a new version was rolled out in one of the various cloud stages.
#
# The updated environment is provided via ENVIRONMENT variable. The seedling
# step will branch and execute pipeline snippets at the following location:
# .buildkite/quality-gates/emergency/pipeline.tests-qa.yaml
# .buildkite/quality-gates/emergency/pipeline.tests-staging.yaml
# .buildkite/quality-gates/emergency/pipeline.tests-production.yaml
